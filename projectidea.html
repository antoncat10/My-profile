												<h3>Overview</h3>
												<p>This project idea falls into the category of being a sports app. It would specifically focus on the football code of AFL whereby subscribers/users of the app would utilise it in improving their craft and skills in the sport. All the respective eighteen clubs in the league are provided in the app to cater for which club the user follows. Adding onto this, three listed players from each club in the positions (defender, midfielder and forward) would provide their training programs that they do in preparation for a match. They'd also provide a few related drills/kicking practice for the user to be able to utilise in their own setting.</p>

												<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
												<p> With this fitness related concept being utilised as both a website and mobile application, access to the best software and hardware tools would be essential in providing subscribers of the app with the best experience whenever they use it. Based on this concept, one of the software's best capable to cater for this would be BuildFire, as it is one of the up comers in terms of its popularity and versatility in mobile app development. It caters for iOS, Android and PWA (progressive web application). It requires no coding and alongside with this, provides an intuitive user interface experience making it useful and helpful in developing and customising your app. Finally its popular in all facets of potential applications, especially with gym and fitness related, something which obviously correlates with this overall project idea.</p>

												<h3>Skills Required</h3>
												<p> In terms of skills required for this project, their would need to be sufficient exposure to developing a mobile app. Attaining knowledge through this would only be feasible through completion of short online courses. These are easily accessible, as the help provides that fundamental understanding of how you can develop a mobile application that is user friendly and provides the overall best experience. Adding onto this, building knowledge on what PWA's are and the advantages that it provides in being safe, responsive and network independent would ultimately lay the core foundation in making the user repetitively come back to using your application. Therefore exposure to guides, specifically developer related is vital in acquiring those necessary skills. </p>

												<h3>Outcome</h3>
												<p>If this project is successful, an outcome of this would be to build on and make a series of further web and mobile-based applications for other sports that users love. They could be other codes like AFLW, NRL, NBL and so on. What also would be attainable and necessary is gaining reviews from subscribers of the app, querying their likes and dislikes of alongside further recommendations on updates/improvements they would like to see within the application. This could possibly be attainable through the option of participating a quick survey. The impact would be significant because these users are paying for a service. They would want to this app to be as user-friendly as possible, to be easy to navigate with and most importantly, assist them in aspiring to improve on their overall footballing repertoire.</p>
