												<h3>Overview</h3>
												<p>This project idea falls into the category of being a sports app. It would specifically focus on the football code of AFL whereby subscribers/users of the app would utilise it in improving their craft and skills in the sport. All the respective eighteen clubs in the league are provided in the app to cater for which club the user follows. Adding onto this, three listed players from each club in the positions (defender, midfielder and forward) would provide their training programs that they do in preparation for a match. They'd also provide a few related drills/kicking practice for the user to be able to utilise in their own setting.</p>
											</div>

											<div class="col-10 col-16-small">
												<h3>What is the motivation?</h3>
												<p>A motivation of this for me would be my love and enjoyment of the sport. It's the biggest sporting league in Australia and with clubs in most states of the country, it's exposure is quite significant to say the least. With this targeting those lover's of the game, it will specifically be catered for youth aspiring to possibly improve their repertoire in wanting to purse a football career. It's also targeted for young adults wanting to follow how their favourite players stay fit in the gym and gain insight into how they further master their kicking practice in the lead up to a match on the weekend.</p>

												<h3><center>Description</center></h3>
												<p>As most fitness apps do provide in the modern world whether its through a mobile application or web-based, this specific app would designed for both services. It would also be a subscription based service, with a monthly offering of $8.00 charged to subscribers. As elucidated before, it is a service provided and targeting the lovers of the footballing code AFL. It would astoundingly target the next generation of stars, being teenagers that play locally, that are wanting to improve their skills in wanting to model their footballing style on the stars of the game. It would also target the position that they favour the best and would want to master when they participate in their respective football matches. Users would have the option to nominate their favourite club to receive notifications on updates to training programs. Their would also be the function to navigate and pick a club as well, if users are wanting to experience what differs all the eighteen clubs from one another.
												<p>
												To put this into perspective lets provide an overall scenario of what this app for a specific club.
												For instance if it was the Collingwood Football Club, their would be three players from the list whom have agreed to provide their training programs alongside with specific tips on kicking and drill practice that they can provide for the subscriber to practice in their own setting. They would be players who play in the three main positions on the field: defender, midfielder and forward.

												<center>EG:</center>
												<center><li> DEFENDER: Darcy Moore</li></center>
												<center><li> MIDFIELDER: Scott Pendlebury</li></center>
												<center><li> FORWARD: Jordan De Goey</li></center>

												<p>
												It's important to note that players would have access to training/gym equipment at their disposal via club training facilities. Therefore, with the subscriber being provided training programs that require use of gym related equipment, it's highly recommended that the user completes this at their local or preferred gym complex. Regarding the training programs provided, their will be a glossary tab part of the app. This would be a section thats provided with a the description of the exercise, stating the tempo required and the number of reps needed. Accompanying this would be a video form representation of how you are meant to execute the exercise.  These programs have a 4 week duration time and after this period, a new program would be uploaded for subscribers to use and they would be notified of this update.
												<p>
												Furthermore, in terms of the drills and kicking practice being provided by the players, their would also be a video series on how to carry out these drills. These drills would be catered for the specific field position that the subscriber is wanting to further improve their footballing craft from, whether it's in the defence, the midfield or attack. Specific to this would be the equipment required, how much space you'd need  and most importantly, how to execute these drills. In most cases, it would be recommended that the subscriber to carry out these sets of practice in a space with an abundance of space, for instance a local football oval.

												<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
												<p> With this fitness related concept being utilised as both a website and mobile application, access to the best software and hardware tools would be essential in providing subscribers of the app with the best experience whenever they use it. Based on this concept, one of the software's best capable to cater for this would be BuildFire, as it is one of the up comers in terms of its popularity and versatility in mobile app development. It caters for iOS, Android and PWA (progressive web application). It requires no coding and alongside with this, provides an intuitive user interface experience making it useful and helpful in developing and customising your app. Finally its popular in all facets of potential applications, especially with gym and fitness related, something which obviously correlates with this overall project idea.</p>

											<div class="col-10 col-16-small">
												<h3>Skills Required</h3>
												<p> In terms of skills required for this project, their would need to be sufficient exposure to developing a mobile app. Attaining knowledge through this would only be feasible through completion of short online courses. These are easily accessible, as the help provides that fundamental understanding of how you can develop a mobile application that is user friendly and provides the overall best experience. Adding onto this, building knowledge on what PWA's are and the advantages that it provides in being safe, responsive and network independent would ultimately lay the core foundation in making the user repetitively come back to using your application. Therefore exposure to guides, specifically developer related is vital in acquiring those necessary skills. </p>

												<h3>Outcome</h3>
												<p>If this project is successful, an outcome of this would be to build on and make a series of further web and mobile-based applications for other sports that users love. They could be other codes like AFLW, NRL, NBL and so on. What also would be attainable and necessary is gaining reviews from subscribers of the app, querying their likes and dislikes of alongside further recommendations on updates/improvements they would like to see within the application. This could possibly be attainable through the option of participating a quick survey. The impact would be significant because these users are paying for a service. They would want to this app to be as user-friendly as possible, to be easy to navigate with and most importantly, assist them in aspiring to improve on their overall footballing repertoire.</p>
