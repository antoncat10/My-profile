<title> Assessment 1: My Profile </title>
</head>
<body style="background-color: green;">

<h2 style="font-size: 30px; color: blue;">Personal Information</h2>
<p>
<img src="myface.jpg.jpg" width="200">

<li>Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia</li>
<li>Have an Italian background, where grandparents from both parents sides immigrated from Italy to Melbourne</li>
<li>I completed primary and secondary school, completing VCE in 2018. I did study for an undergraduate degree in Speech Pathology at ACU. I withdrew at the end of 2020 to pursue something that I am more interested and passionate about, which is Information Technology.</li>
<li>Speak fluent English</li>
<li>Passionate follower of sport, especially AFL and EPL.</li>
<li>Barrack for Collingwood and Everton, respectively. Other interests include going to the gym, going out and socialising, alongside playing video games, especially FIFA</li>
</p>

<h2> Interest in IT</h2>
<p>
<li>Perhaps a fundamental interest in IT is the fact that I am engaging with technology daily. Whether it's from a television set to a laptop, I utilise it everyday. What's been a constant reminder of gaining interest in IT is of me solving errors that I come across when using a laptop. Its something that I enjoy and some degree find simple, where as others are puzzled at how I solved the problem.</li>
<li>Personally, choosing RMIT for an Information Technology degree was a no brainer. Being in a central location in the CBD was a beneficiary for me, however, it's been recommended to me by friends and family to be one of/ if not, the best IT bachelor degree in the state. Also, being able to select a particular field of subjects to minor and major in was something that really caught my attention, as it was something that wasn't offered in my previous studies.</li>
<li>I expect to learn all the necessary teachings and skills in upholding what it takes to be a successful IT Professional. Being practical and getting that hands on experience is something that I strive and really enjoy, instead of constantly having my head in the books. This can also be from experiencing the day to day life of someone working in the IT field, whether its from undertaking a internship or professional placement. Gaining contacts as well would be key. I am really looking forward to my studies in IT throughout the next three years.</li>

</p>

<h2> Ideal Job</h2>
 <h3 style= "text-align center">IT APPLICATION SUPPORT</h3>
 <p>                            

<li>This job specifically revolves around providing support and assisting customers of the company solve their IT related problems. Adding onto this, you would correspond with customer app's and the technological background segregated to this. Its catered not only to fixing specific issues but to also really invest and go all in with the clients approach in helping delight the customers of the app.
You would need to have great skills in utilising Windows and knowing how to use a computer. Furthermore you'd need to have sufficient knowledge in operating Active Directory Users and Computers, whilst also being experienced in utilising Group Policies. Ensuring you have the adaptability in such a fast paced environment is necessary, with embodying the willingness to learn being a key skill the company is looking for.</li>
<li>Currently, I have great knowledge in knowing how to use a computer. Having utilised a computer for over 10 years now, I can understand the specific basics on how to use it. I'm also a keen learner and am willing to add some key skills to my arsenal. Whether its from at my casual job to currently in my first year, I'm really invested in learning new things and gaining such valuable insight.</li>
<li>Adaptability is a key skill that I know I need to work on. I know patience is required, however familiarising myself with an environment and understanding the task and protocols at hand is something that I'm eager to work on. This can be obtained from gaining workplace experience at an IT related internship. Furthermore, honing my in depth knowledge on how it is to operate Windows and other programs such as Active Directory Users and Computers would be a necessary to expose myself to and it can be from viewing tutorials or completing short crash courses on mastering how to operate these systems.</li>
 </p>

<h2> Personal Profile </h2>
<p>
<li>With the results collated in the three tests, they all particularly outline to a certain degree how I'm perceived to behave, from a personality, learning and creativity perspective. Based upon the MBTI test, exhibiting the consul personality type means that I'm strongly successful in showing loyalty, being practical and connecting with others, whilst showing vulnerability to criticism, being needy and selfless. The learning style test exhibited how much of a tactile learner I am, with the qualities of being hands on and understanding things through physical movement. What's intuitive that I particularly related to was being active and having difficulty sitting still, a noticeable habit of mine. The creativity test analysed that my creativity is a "work in progress", something that I know that I'm especially keen to improve on. It's the qualities of strengthening my confidence in sharing my ideas and asking how fellow members perceive them that will only strive in getting me to that next level of creativity.</li>
<p>
<li>What's pivotal to understand about myself is that despite my strengths in communicating well with others, that does come with familiarity with my fellow team members and time. The more I understand how a person behaves and how they communicate, the more comfortable I become. Learning wise, I wouldn't particularly exhibit my tactile style straight away and I would be keen to understand how others do learn, before being decisive in whether its right to express my style or not. Creatively, it would be vital in my confidence to pitch my ideas or thoughts early on, instead of sitting back and missing out on expressing my thoughts. Its something that I know personally would not only help build that self-confidence but would especially help gain that level understanding with my team.</li>
<p>
<li>Formation of teams is always quite the challenging situation. Everyone is unique in their own personality and how they act in teams may counteract how they act in different environments. Therefore when taking into account the results collated in the three respective tests, it would be vital to format teams with people that exhibit and relate with 1-2 conditions. Building rapport would all the more necessary in these environments, yet, understanding how an individual acts in those few solitary moments would be all the more important in knowing you can relate with them. Showing those few qualities that you can associate with your fellow team members would ultimately help make completing the task more successful but more enjoyable as well.</li>

<h2> Project Idea: FootFit  </h2>
<p>
<li>This project idea falls into the category of being a sports app. It would specifically focus on the football code of AFL whereby subscribers/users of the app would utilise it in improving their craft and skills in the sport. All the respective eighteen clubs in the league are provided in the app to cater for which club the user follows. Adding onto this, three listed players from each club in the positions (defender, midfielder and forward) would provide their training programs that they do in preparation for a match. They'd also provide a few related drills/kicking practice for the user to be able to utilise in their own setting.</li>
<p>
<li>A motivation of this for me would be my love and enjoyment of the sport. It's the biggest sporting league in Australia and with clubs in most states of the country, it's exposure is quite significant to say the least. With this targeting those lover's of the game, it will specifically be catered for youth aspiring to possibly improve their repertoire in wanting to purse a football career. It's also targeted for young adults wanting to follow how their favourite players stay fit in the gym and gain insight into how they further master their kicking practice in the lead up to a match on the weekend.</li>
<p>
<li>As most fitness apps do provide in the modern world whether its through a mobile application or web-based, this specific app would designed for both services. It would also be a subscription based service, with a monthly offering of $8.00 charged to subscribers. As elucidated before, it is a service provided and targeting the lovers of the footballing code AFL. It would astoundingly target the next generation of stars, being teenagers that play locally, that are wanting to improve their skills in wanting to model their footballing style on the stars of the game. It would also target the position that they favour the best and would want to master when they participate in their respective football matches. Users would have the option to nominate their favourite club to receive notifications on updates to training programs. Their would also be the function to navigate and pick a club as well, if users are wanting to experience what differs all the eighteen clubs from one another.</li>
<p>
To put this into perspective lets provide an overall scenario of what this app for a specific club:
<p>
For instance if it was the Collingwood Football Club, their would be three players from the list whom have agreed to provide their training programs alongside with specific tips on kicking and drill practice that they can provide for the subscriber to practice in their own setting. They would be players who play in the three main positions on the field: defender, midfielder and forward.

<p>EG:
<li> DEFENDER: Darcy Moore</li>
<li> MIDFIELDER: Scott Pendlebury</li>
<li> FORWARD: Jordan De Goey</li>
<p>
<li>It's important to note that players would have access to training/gym equipment at their disposal via club training facilities. Therefore, with the subscriber being provided training programs that require use of gym related equipment, it's highly recommended that the user completes this at their local or preferred gym complex. Regarding the training programs provided, their will be a glossary tab part of the app. This would be a section thats provided with a the description of the exercise, stating the tempo required and the number of reps needed. Accompanying this would be a video form representation of how you are meant to execute the exercise.  These programs have a 4 week duration time and after this period, a new program would be uploaded for subscribers to use and they would be notified of this update.</li>
<p>
<li>Furthermore, in terms of the drills and kicking practice being provided by the players, their would also be a video series on how to carry out these drills. These drills would be catered for the specific field position that the subscriber is wanting to further improve their footballing craft from, whether it's in the defence, the midfield or attack. Specific to this would be the equipment required, how much space you'd need  and most importantly, how to execute these drills. In most cases, it would be recommended that the subscriber to carry out these sets of practice in a space with an abundance of space, for instance a local football oval.</li>
<p>
<li>With this fitness related concept being utilised as both a website and mobile application, access to the best software and hardware tools would be essential in providing subscribers of the app with the best experience whenever they use it. Based on this concept, one of the software's best capable to cater for this would be BuildFire, as it is one of the up comers in terms of its popularity and versatility in mobile app development. It caters for iOS, Android and PWA (progressive web application). It requires no coding and alongside with this, provides an intuitive user interface experience making it useful and helpful in developing and customising your app. Finally its popular in all facets of potential applications, especially with gym and fitness related, something which obviously correlates with this overall project idea.</li>
<p>
<li>In terms of skills required for this project, their would need to be sufficient exposure to developing a mobile app. Attaining knowledge through this would only be feasible through completion of short online courses. These are easily accessible, as the help provides that fundamental understanding of how you can develop a mobile application that is user friendly and provides the overall best experience. Adding onto this, building knowledge on what PWA's are and the advantages that it provides in being safe, responsive and network independent would ultimately lay the core foundation in making the user repetitively come back to using your application. Therefore exposure to guides, specifically developer related is vital in acquiring those necessary skills.</li>
<p>
<li>If this project is successful, an outcome of this would be to build on and make a series of further web and mobile-based applications for other sports that users love. They could be other codes like AFLW, NRL, NBL and so on. What also would be attainable and necessary is gaining reviews from subscribers of the app, querying their likes and dislikes of alongside further recommendations on updates/improvements they would like to see within the application. This could possibly be attainable through the option of participating a quick survey. The impact would be significant because these users are paying for a service. They would want to this app to be as user-friendly as possible, to be easy to navigate with and most importantly, assist them in aspiring to improve on their overall footballing repertoire.</li> </p>
