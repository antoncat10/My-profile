										<h3><center>Description</center></h3>
										<p>As most fitness apps do provide in the modern world whether its through a mobile application or web-based, <strong>this specific app would designed for both services. It would also be a subscription based service, with a monthly offering of $12.00 charged to subscribers.</strong> As highlighted before, it is a service provided and targeting the lovers of the footballing code, AFL. It would specifically target the next generation of stars, being teenagers that play locally, that are wanting to improve their skills and perhaps model their footballing style with the stars of the game. It would also target the position that they favour the best and would want to master. Users would have the option to nominate their favourite club to receive notifications on updates to training programs. Their would also be the function to navigate and pick a club as well, if users are wanting to experience what differs all the eighteen clubs from one another.
										<p>
										To put this into perspective lets provide an overall scenario of what this app for a specific club.
										For instance if it was the Collingwood Football Club, their would be three players from the list whom have agreed to provide their training programs alongside with specific tips on kicking and drill practice that they can provide for the subscriber to practice in their own setting. They would be players who play in the three main positions on the field: defender, midfielder and forward.</p>

										<p><center>EG:</center>
										<center><li> DEFENDER: Darcy Moore</li></center>
										<center><li> MIDFIELDER: Taylor Adams</li></center>
										<center><li> FORWARD: Brody Mihocek</li></center></p>

										<p>
										It's important to note that players would have access to training/gym equipment at their disposal via club training facilities. Therefore, with the subscriber being provided training programs that require use of gym related equipment, it's highly recommended that the user completes this at their local or preferred gym complex. Regarding the training programs provided, their will be a glossary tab part of the app. This would be a section thats provided with a the description of the exercise, stating the tempo required and the number of reps needed. Accompanying this would be a video form representation of how you are meant to execute the exercise.  These programs have a 4 week duration time and after this period, a new program would be uploaded for subscribers to use and they would be notified of this update.
										<p>
										Furthermore, in terms of the drills and kicking practice being provided by the players, their would also be a video series on how to carry out these drills. These drills would be catered for the specific field position that the subscriber is wanting to further improve their footballing craft from, whether it's in the defence, the midfield or attack. Specific to this would be the equipment required, how much space you'd need and most importantly, how to execute these drills. In most cases, it would be recommended that the subscriber carry out these sets of practice drills in a space with an abundance of space, for instance a local football oval.
