											<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
											<p> With this fitness related concept being utilised as both a website and mobile application, access to the best software and hardware tools would be essential in providing subscribers of the app with the best experience whenever they use it. Based on this concept, one of the software's best capable to cater for this would be BuildFire, as it is one of the up comers in terms of its popularity and versatility in mobile app development. It caters for iOS, Android and PWA (progressive web application). It requires no coding and alongside with this, provides an intuitive user interface experience making it useful and helpful in developing and customising your app. Finally its popular in all facets of potential applications, especially with gym and fitness related, something which obviously correlates with this overall project idea.</p>
