												<h3>Interest</h3>
												<p>Perhaps a fundamental interest in IT is the fact that I am engaging with technology daily. Whether it's from a television set to a laptop, I utilise it everyday. What's been a constant reminder of gaining interest in IT is of me solving errors that I come across when using a laptop. Its something that I enjoy and some degree find simple, where as others are puzzled at how I solved the problem.</p>

												<h3>Why did you choose RMIT?</h3>
												<p>Personally, choosing RMIT for an Information Technology degree was a no brainer. Being in a central location in the CBD was a beneficiary for me, however, it's been recommended to me by friends and family to be one of/ if not, the best IT bachelor degree in the state. Also, being able to select a particular field of subjects to minor and major in was something that really caught my attention, as it was something that wasn't offered in my previous studies.</p>

												<h3>Expectations</h3>
												<p>I expect to learn all the necessary teachings and skills in upholding what it takes to be a successful IT Professional. Being practical and getting that hands on experience is something that I strive and really enjoy, instead of constantly having my head in the books. This can also be from experiencing the day to day life of someone working in the IT field, whether its from undertaking a internship or professional placement. Gaining contacts as well would be key. I am really looking forward to my studies in IT throughout the next three years.</p>
