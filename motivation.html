												<h3>What is the motivation?</h3>
												<p>A motivation of this for me would be my love and enjoyment of the sport. It's the biggest sporting league in Australia and with clubs in most states of the country, it's exposure is quite significant to say the least. With this targeting those lover's of the game, it will specifically be catered for youth aspiring to possibly improve their repertoire in wanting to purse a football career. It's also targeted for young adults wanting to follow how their favourite players stay fit in the gym and gain insight into how they further master their kicking practice in the lead up to a match on the weekend.</p>
