										<h3>Skills Required</h3>
										<p> In terms of skills required for this project, their would need to be <strong>sufficient exposure to developing a mobile app.</strong> Attaining knowledge through this would only be feasible through completion of short online courses. These are easily accessible, as the help provides that fundamental understanding of how you can develop a mobile application that is user friendly and provides the overall best experience. Adding onto this, building knowledge on what PWA's are and the advantages that it provides in being safe, responsive and network independent would ultimately lay the core foundation in making the user consistently come back to use your application. Therefore exposure to guides, specifically developer related is vital in acquiring those necessary skills. </p>
