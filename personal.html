										<li>With the results collated in the three tests, they all particularly outline to a certain degree how I'm perceived to behave, from a personality, learning and creativity perspective. Based upon the MBTI test, exhibiting the consul personality type means that I'm strongly successful in showing loyalty, being practical and connecting with others, whilst showing vulnerability to criticism, being needy and selfless. The learning style test exhibited how much of a tactile learner I am, with the qualities of being hands on and understanding things through physical movement. What's intuitive that I particularly related to was being active and having difficulty sitting still, a noticeable habit of mine. The creativity test analysed that my creativity is a "work in progress", something that I know that I'm especially keen to improve on. It's the qualities of strengthening my confidence in sharing my ideas and asking how fellow members perceive them that will only strive in getting me to that next level of creativity.</li>
										<p>
										<li>What's pivotal to understand about myself is that despite my strengths in communicating well with others, that does come with familiarity with my fellow team members and time. The more I understand how a person behaves and how they communicate, the more comfortable I become. Learning wise, I wouldn't particularly exhibit my tactile style straight away and I would be keen to understand how others do learn, before being decisive in whether its right to express my style or not. Creatively, it would be vital in my confidence to pitch my ideas or thoughts early on, instead of sitting back and missing out on expressing my thoughts. Its something that I know personally would not only help build that self-confidence but would especially help gain that level understanding with my team.</li>
										<p>
										<li>Formation of teams is always quite the challenging situation. Everyone is unique in their own personality and how they act in teams may counteract how they act in different environments. Therefore when taking into account the results collated in the three respective tests, it would be vital to format teams with people that exhibit and relate with 1-2 conditions. Building rapport would all the more necessary in these environments, yet, understanding how an individual acts in those few solitary moments would be all the more important in knowing you can relate with them. Showing those few qualities that you can associate with your fellow team members would ultimately help make completing the task more successful but more enjoyable as well.</li>
